/// A type representing schema that can be reused by `StateMachine` instances.
///
/// Schema incorporates three generic types: `State` and `Event`, which should
/// be `enum`s, and `Subject`, which represents an object associated with
/// a state machine.  If you don't want to associate any object, use `Void`
/// as `Subject` type.
///
/// Schema indicates the initial state and describes transition logic â€” how
/// states are connected via events and what code is executed during state
/// transitions.  You specify transition logic as a block that accepts two
/// arguments: current state and event being handled.  It returns an optional
/// tuple of a new state and an optional transition block.  When the tuple is
/// `nil`, it indicates that there is no transition for given state-event
/// pair, i.e. given event should be ignored in given state.  When the tuple
/// is non-`nil`, it specifies the new state that machine should transition to
/// and a block that should be called after the transition.  The transition
/// block is optional and it gets passed a `Subject` object as an argument.
